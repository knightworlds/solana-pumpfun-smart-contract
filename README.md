# Pumpfun Solana Smart Contract

Welcome to the Pumpfun Solana Smart Contract repository. This repository contains the Rust/Anchor-based smart contract powering the Pumpfun ecosystem.

If you have any questions or need support, feel free to reach out, and we can discuss the best way to assist you.



## Key Features
The contract includes all the advanced features that define the Pumpfun platform:

‚úÖ Token Minting
Seamlessly mint Pumpfun tokens to kickstart your liquidity pool.

‚úÖ Create Liquidity Pools
Establish a pool with an initial 30 SOL virtual reserve, creating a strong foundation for token transactions.

‚úÖ Add Liquidity
Contribute liquidity to grow the pool and enhance token marketability.

‚úÖ  Token Swapping
Facilitates token swaps based on a dynamic bonding curve price, calculated as:
`Price = Virtual SOL Reserve / Virtual Token Reserve.`

‚úÖ Raydium Launch Integration

Automatically launch on Raydium when the token‚Äôs market cap (price √ó 10‚Åπ) reaches $69M. At launch:
- $12K in SOL ($24K total liquidity) is added to Raydium.
- Remaining liquidity reserves are allocated to the Pumpfun team for platform growth.

## Unique Bonding Curve Logic

The contract uses a custom bonding curve mechanism defined by:
`X √ó Y = K¬≤`
- X: Token price.
- Y: Token supply in the pool.
This ensures a dynamic and balanced liquidity model tailored to Pumpfun‚Äôs tokenomics.

## Testing and Validation

### The contract includes comprehensive test cases to validate functionality, covering all features except Raydium Launch (which integrates with the ongoing project).
- Remove Virtual LP and Create Raydium Pool:

### LP Creation Fee
